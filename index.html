<body>
<p>
Although literature is less popular today, storytelling remains a powerful strategy in a broad range of professional disciplines. In this workshop, we explored how storytelling extends beyond books, blending texts with performance techniques, multimedia expressions, and digital tools. Participants were invited to write poems or short stories using experimental techniques and adapting their work across different media such as performance, drawing, video, or photography. Participants collaborated on the creation of this GitHub-hosted repository of their works.
