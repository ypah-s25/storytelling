<p><strong>Monica Chen</strong><br>
Monica is a rising junior at Amity. She chose to take the Storytelling class to become better at expressing her ideas. She believes that, although humans are imperfect, art is the closest form of human expression that approaches perfection, and that is why she will continue her boundless pursuit of art. Outside of writing and art in general, Monica enjoys playing on the volleyball team, competing in piano competitions, and advocating for youth empowerment. She hopes that tomorrow’s world will become shaped by art and individual expression.</p>

<p><b>Ada Semmel:</b> Ada is a rising senior at New Haven Academy. She chose to take the Storytelling workshop because writing has always been intimidating to her.

She has been singing in a church choir since the age of nine, and considers music to be one of her greatest passions. Ada is the fourth child out of five, and she has two dogs.

<p><strong>Ivana Torres</strong><br>
My name is Ivana Torres and I'm 15 years old. I'm an upcoming sophomore and a goal of mine is getting better at writing stories. Reading books used to be a big hobby for me and my love for books still stands, although I don't read as frequently as before. I hope to end up expanding my knowledge by reading even more and becoming a better writer by the end of it.</p>

<p><strong>Jordan Smith</strong><br>
<p></p>Jordan Smith is a rising senior at Metropolitan Business Academy. She’s a great enjoyer of all things retro and frilly. In her free time, she can be found obsesing over The Beatles, reading a thick book, or watching a fifty year old movie. Foolishly, she hopes to be a polymath someday. Jordan lives in East Haven and hopes to survive college applications enough to crawl into a four year university in her home state of Connecticut.</p>
