<p><strong>Monica Chen</strong><br>
Monica is a rising junior at Amity. She chose to take the Storytelling class to become better at expressing her ideas. She believes that, although humans are imperfect, art is the closest form of human expression that approaches perfection, and that is why she will continue her boundless pursuit of art. Outside of writing and art in general, Monica enjoys playing on the volleyball team, competing in piano competitions, and advocating for youth empowerment. She hopes that tomorrowâ€™s world will become shaped by art and individual expression.</p>
Monica lives in Orange, CT with her cat, Millie.
