Although literature is less popular today, storytelling remains a powerful strategy in a broad range of professional disciplines. In this workshop, we explore how storytelling extends beyond books, blending texts with performance techniques, multimedia expressions, and digital tools. Participants will write poems or short stories using experimental techniques, adapting their work across different media such as performance, drawing, video, or photography. Participants will also collaborate on the creation of a GitHub-hosted anthology with their work, acquiring minimal computing skills on HTML and digital editing tools. The purpose is to inspire participants to explore contemporary approaches to literary expression by integrating notions of performance, transmediality, and basic web design.
