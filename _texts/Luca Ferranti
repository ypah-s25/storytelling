Sun rays rest upon the yellow grass 
Roots of the acacia tree stretching for miles 
In search for water a tree is like any other type of life,
Under the beating sun starved for nutrition 
<p> </p>
The neck of the giraffe sticks out over the rock like a watch tower
A lion stalks through the tall grass
Creeping up on a gazelle it steps with caution 
It jumps towards the gazelle and miraculously
The Lion misses the prey 
In terror and instinct the gazelle escapes
<p> </p>
A pursuit commences   
With speed and deadly intent the 
Lion is still too slow
Maybe out of his prime he rests
In the grass exhausted 
No meal for the night 
<p> </p>
The neck of the giraffe points his eyes over to the right 
A poacher sits in the bush 
Sights set on the tired lion
