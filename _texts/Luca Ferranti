<p>
<br>Sun rays rest upon the yellow grass 
<br>Roots of the acacia tree stretching for miles 
<br>In search for water a tree is like any other type of life,
<br>Under the beating sun starved for nutrition 
</p>
<p>
<br>The neck of the giraffe sticks out over the rock like a watch tower
<br>A lion stalks through the tall grass
<br>Creeping up on a gazelle it steps with caution 
<br>It jumps towards the gazelle and miraculously
<br>The Lion misses the prey 
<br>In terror and instinct the gazelle escapes
</p>

<p>
<br>A pursuit commences   
<br>With speed and deadly intent the 
<br>Lion is still too slow
<br>Maybe out of his prime he rests
<br>In the grass exhausted 
<br>No meal for the night 
</p>

<p>
<br>The neck of the giraffe points his eyes over to the right 
<br>A poacher sits in the bush 
<br>Sights set on the tired lion 
</p>
