<p><strong>Act I - Diamond of the season<strong></p>

<p>Elira had learned to play the piano at five, embroidered perfectly at seven, spoke French and Italian, and was very polite, never saying too much. She was the very image of perfection. Since her mother died one cold December night, her father made her upbringing a mission: to raise her into the most refined lady, the ideal wife for the future count. However, despite being the perfect lady, Elira, at 18, had never loved anyone.</p>

<p>Not for lack of suitors, she was one of the most coveted ladies, however even the Duke of Waterbury himself found her common…</p>

<p> - "They're after you for your last name, not your soul," her sister would say. Mira, the black sheep of the family, had stopped making her debut two years ago, despite her father's desperate attempts to make her become an exemplary lady. Mira lived in Edinburgh, devoting herself to painting and reading.</p>

<p>One day during a visit to the city, Elira slipped into the back of a bookstore, seeking fresh air away from her maid. There, on the sidewalk, she found a young man reciting poetry to passersby. He had disheveled hair, simple clothes, and dreamy eyes.</P>

<p> - "Did you get lost, my lady?" the young man said, seeing her stop in front of him with an expression of admiration and astonishment.<p>

<p>His name was Elias, son of artists, untitled poets, raised in the freedom without rules of art.</p>

<p>In the following weeks, Elira and Elias met in secret. He read his poetry to her, while she looked at him as if he were the only thing in the universe. While she played pieces on the piano in the abandoned conservatory, Elira felt for the first time that she wasn't playing a role, that she could be herself, that she was living.</p>

<p>But it couldn't last.</p>

<p><strong>Act II - Dreams that sweep away<strong></p>

<p>The summer social season was almost over, and Elias had to leave. He had been invited to Edinburgh to publish his first book, based on poems he had written over the years, including some about Elira. It was his dream, the one he had spent his entire life working toward.</p>

<p>The night before leaving, he handed Elira a letter.</p>

<p> - “Read it when you are ready, but do not seek me if you choose to stay here.”</p>

<p>She never opened it. She feared losing the only person who made her feel like herself, the only one who saw beyond the façade of the “Diamond of the Season.”</p>

<p>But she feared even more losing the image of the perfect daughter her father had fought so hard to preserve.</p>

<p>And so… she let him go.</p>

<p>Two years passed. Elira attended balls, turned down proposals—not only because she wasn’t interested, but because she still hoped that, by the will of fate, Elias would one day return for her.</p>

<p>She surrendered herself to an empty routine… until Mira returned from Edinburgh.</p>

<p>“I’ve met someone,” Mira said with a flirty smile.</p>

<p>“So soon?” Elira asked.</p>

<p>“He’s special… strange… free. He writes poetry with such passion, as if he could not breathe without it.”</p>

<p>The surprise came when Mira brought this “someone” home.</p>

<p>And there was Elias, standing in the drawing room, holding a white rose, with the same dreamy eyes from years ago.</p>

<p>When their eyes met, there was no scandal—only a silence that spoke louder than a thousand words.</p>

<p>“A pleasure to meet you, Lady Elira.”</p>

<p>“The pleasure is mine… Mr. Elias.”</p>

<p>They both pretended not to remember… all the afternoons spent behind the bookshop, sharing their deepest secrets, playing like children.</p>

<p>Mira suspected nothing; her life was different—rebellious, free, carefree.</p>

<p>Their father no longer tried to control her.</p>

<p>Elira, on the other hand, was still trapped between duty and her desire for her father’s approval.</p>

<p>One night, finding each other in the library during a bout of insomnia brought on by the situation, Elias approached Elira.</p>

<p>“You opened the letter, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“I burned it,” Elira whispered. “I could not allow my love for you to destroy everything I have worked for.”</p>

<p><strong>Act III - When the sun begins to rise<strong></p>

<p>The following days were tense. Elira began to see Elias with her sister—laughing, sharing poems he had once only read to her. Her heart broke a little more with each passing day.</p>

<p>But fate was not finished.</p>

<p>One afternoon during a social gathering, Mira introduced Elira as her sister to a group of artists.</p>

<p>Until then, Elias had not known they were sisters.</p>

<p>He withdrew at once. He sought her in the gardens.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me?”</p>

<p>“Tell you what? That the woman you share your verses with is my own blood?”</p>

<p>“But I would have understood. I would have done something.”</p>

<p>“It’s too late now, Elias.”</p>

<p>They both knew they could not go back.</p>

<p>That same night, Mira noticed something.</p>

<p>She looked at Elira with a mix of understanding and sorrow.</p>

<p>“You loved him too, didn’t you?” she asked.<p>

<p>“I still do.”</p>

<p>And without another word, Mira packed her things and left the next day.</p>

<p>She did not complain.</p>

<p>She left only a note:</p>

<p>“Sometimes freedom is choosing to let go of what you love, so it can truly be free.”</p>

<p>“Do you still think it’s too late? That we’re not part of the same world?”</p>

<p>She looked at him, without piano, without verses, only with the voice of someone who had finally chosen herself.</p>

<p>“Do you still think it’s too late? That we’re not part of the same world?”</p>

<p>“No… I think this is the right moment to start writing my own story… our story.”</p>

<p>They fled to the north, leaving behind all the limits placed upon their love.</p>

<p>There was no public scandal, only whispers.</p>

<p>Years later, a small bookshop in the heart of the city would bear its name: “Affair of the Heart”</p>

<p>Founded by an elegant woman who had learned to live for herself,</p>
<p>and a poet who had loved her since the very first note.</p>
