<p><strong>Act I - Diamond of the season<strong></p>

<p>Elira had learned to play the piano at five, embroidered perfectly at seven, spoke French and Italian, and was very polite, never saying too much. She was the very image of perfection. Since her mother died one cold December night, her father made her upbringing a mission: to raise her into the most refined lady, the ideal wife for the future count. However, despite being the perfect lady, Elira, at 18, had never loved anyone.</p>

<p>Not for lack of suitors, she was one of the most coveted ladies, however even the Duke of Waterbury himself found her commonâ€¦</p>

<p> - "They're after you for your last name, not your soul," her sister would say. Mira, the black sheep of the family, had stopped making her debut two years ago, despite her father's desperate attempts to make her become an exemplary lady. Mira lived in Edinburgh, devoting herself to painting and reading.</p>

<p>One day during a visit to the city, Elira slipped into the back of a bookstore, seeking fresh air away from her maid. There, on the sidewalk, she found a young man reciting poetry to passersby. He had disheveled hair, simple clothes, and dreamy eyes.</P>

<p> - "Did you get lost, my lady?" the young man said, seeing her stop in front of him with an expression of admiration and astonishment.<p>

<p>His name was Elias, son of artists, untitled poets, raised in the freedom without rules of art.</p>

<p>In the following weeks, Elira and Elias met in secret. He read his poetry to her, while she looked at him as if he were the only thing in the universe. While she played pieces on the piano in the abandoned conservatory, Elira felt for the first time that she wasn't playing a role, that she could be herself, that she was living.</p>

<p>But it couldn't last.</p>

<p><strong>Act II - Dreams that sweep away<strong></p>

<p>The summer social season was almost over, and Elias had to leave. He had been invited to Edinburgh to publish his first book, based on poems he had written over the years, including some about Elira. It was his dream, the one he had spent his entire life working toward.</p>
