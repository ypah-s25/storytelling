 <p> The waxy smell of orange-yellow
<br> A princess band-aid that seems to always be on my knee
<br>The soapy taste of bottled bubbles
<br>No alphabet or addition for a whole
<br>Summer
</p>
</p> The thought of college applications looming in my mind
<br>Listening to an artist’s new album at midnight
<br>Drinking a Dr Pepper next to the breeze of the AC
<br>No calculus or conjugations for a whole
<br>Summer</p>
</p>Typing into a never ending spreadsheet in mid-July
<br>Taking a lunch break with the city’s scorching heat and an iced matcha
<br>My weekends spent jumping into a cool lake
<br>No snowfalls or sniffles for a whole
<br>Summer</p>
