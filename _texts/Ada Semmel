<p> The waxy smell of orange-yellow
A princess band-aid that seems to always be on my knee
The soapy taste of bottled bubbles
No alphabet or addition for a whole
Summer
</p>
</p> The thought of college applications looming in my mind
Listening to an artist’s new album at midnight
Drinking a Dr Pepper next to the breeze of the AC
No calculus or conjugations for a whole
Summer</p>
</p>Typing into a never ending spreadsheet in mid-July
Taking a lunch break with the city’s scorching heat and an iced matcha
My weekends spent jumping into a cool lake
No snowfalls or sniffles for a whole
Summer</p>
