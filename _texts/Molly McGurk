<p> <div> As I wake up in the morning there is no sunshine  </div>
<div>  greeting me from the cracks in the curtain. </div>
<div>  I stretch out of bed and slide into my slippers,  </div>
<div> getting up to peer out the window.  </div>
<div> The fog is so thick I’m unable to see the pond down the hill,  </div>
<div> covering the earth like a blanket.  </div> </p>

<p> <div>  Tiptoeing down the hallway  </div>
<div> I make my way downstairs,  </div>
<div> avoiding the creaks and squeaks.   </div>
<div> Then start the kettle and pour my cup of tea. </div> </p>

<p> <div> Out on the rocking chair I’m accompanied </div>
<div> by the birds singing perched right next to me </div>
<div> After I finish the last drop I begin to make my stroll down the hill </div> </p>

<p> <div> The fog is now a canopy over me, </div>
<div> sticks and leaves crinkle as I walk over them </div>
<div> I hear the stream trickle down the hill to the pond </div>
<div> Taking the same path as I am </div>
<div> Something stirs upon my arrival, </div>
<div> but I’m unable to make out what it is through the thicket </div>
<div> Slowly I make my way closer and the white creature seen through the cracks reveals to be a swan </div> </p>
