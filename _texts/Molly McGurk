<p>As I wake up in the morning there is no sunshine  </div>
 greeting me from the cracks in the curtain. </div>
 I stretch out of bed and slide into my slippers,  </div>
getting up to peer out the window.  </div>
The fog is so thick I’m unable to see the pond down the hill,  </div>
covering the earth like a blanket.  </div>

<p> Tiptoeing down the hallway  </div>
I make my way downstairs,  </div>
avoiding the creaks and squeaks.   </div>
 Then start the kettle and pour my cup of tea. </div>

Out on the rocking chair I’m accompanied </div>
by the birds singing perched right next to me </div>
After I finish the last drop I begin to make my stroll down the hill </div>

The fog is now a canopy over me, </div>
 sticks and leaves crinkle as I walk over them </div>
I hear the stream trickle down the hill to the pond </div>
Taking the same path as I am </div>
Something stirs upon my arrival, </div>
but I’m unable to make out what it is through the thicket </div>
Slowly I make my way closer and the white creature seen through the cracks reveals to be a swan </div>
