<p>Colorado has a certain picturesque quality. The Rocky Mountains glimmer with the snow on their tips, and each street looks like the embodiment of a feel-good holiday movie. Thrill seekers visit in the winter to slide down winter hills. For their children, horse-drawn sleigh rides line the streets.</p>
<p>For a week it is lovely. No stress, just visiting. However, the cold biting naked noses, the frostbite threatening the fingers, and the muddy slush trespassing in hefty boots make this locale an endeavor for locals. Snowy regions are fun until you have to endure them. Even worse is enduring such a climate unwillingly.</p>
<p>If one’s parents choose to be or are coldblooded by nature, there’s no choice but to endure. If the child yearns for the warmth of sand upon their feet, how wholeheartedly miserable must Colorado’s frigidity be. Disappointing once more is how ideal the lifestyle seems. Tourist areas attract, but perhaps not empathy.</p>
<p>All those young who want to escape may only relate to those freezing with them. The trees. The streams. The hibernating beasts. They know this cycle better than any. At least the children only must wait eighteen years to escape. Nature is not as commonly lucky. Planted by growers even if the soil is not what they need.</p> 
<p>Sunflowers cannot thrive in the winter, but that does not stop the most avid from attempting to persuade them to bloom. In this picturesque, suburban chill, nature only can comfort those who ache together with.</p>
