<p>1997, june 27. Zoe was sitting at her desk beside her window writing in her journal, when her turquoise rodery phone began to ring. She dropped her pen against the clean, white pages as she then reached to silence the ringing. "Hey! Zoe would you want to go to our beach house tomorow?" Zoe leaned back in her chair with her arms crossed and the telephone pressed up to her ear, the speaker hovering over her mouth. She took a second to think before she relpied. "Arent you grounded, greer?" *Zoe seeemed almost skeptical of the whole situation, her hesitation flowing clealry through her voice. "not anymore. ever since alex took the blame for me our parents havent been as hostile." Zoe began writing in her journal again as she started speaking. "sure, how long are we staying this time?" "we were thinking maybe a week." Zoe smiled softly to herself when she nodded as if greer could see her. "id love to, ill start packing now" After a second, zoe hung up the phone.</p>
<p>She pushed herself away from the desk, her wooden cushion chair scraping against the floor as she stood up. She walked over to her metal bed before kneeling beside it, reaching underneath, and pulling her handheld suitcase out. She placed the slightly beaten up case on her mattress before clicking the laches open, and tossing it ajar. she walked over to her closet, slid the door and began picking out what to where throughout her and her friends vacation. As zoe walked back and forward throughout her room packing different items shes sure shell need, her small calico cat brushed up against her left leg starting at its head, ending at the tip of its tail. Zoe momentairly delayed her task as she looked down at her cat milo. She slowly kneeled down and scooped him up in her arms, holding him close to her chest as he purred. "you cant come with me love, im sorry." Her voice hinted a slight disapointment as she then set him on her bed.
