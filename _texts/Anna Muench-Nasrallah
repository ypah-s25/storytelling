<p>He smells of sea salt as he leads me to the current.
<br>My tiny toddler hands can only fit around,
<br>one of his grandpa fingers.
<br>He sits me on a sandy rock and faces me towards the seashore.
<br>Lettting go of my hand as he points and tells me to look.
<br>So I do.
<br>At the sea gently slapping barncle rocks, and the soppy sand beneath my toes
<br>at the gentle line of the sun going down on the horizin.
<br>Life comes in currents he says
<br>some may be hot and others cold. 
<br>He places a pebble in my hand his skin rough with years of labour.
<br>You will change like this rock 
<br>but dont forget, just becuse your diffrent doesnt change that your a rock.</p>
