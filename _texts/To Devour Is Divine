<p> They say love is tender, a rose in bloom,
But I have known it as a darker tomb
Where hunger lives not in the gut,
But in the soul’s slow-burning rut.</p>

<p> To love you was to feel the ache
Of wanting more than flesh could take
Not hand in hand, but tooth to bone,
To taste you wholly, not alone.</p>

<p> I craved the essence of your thought,
The marrow where your secrets rot.
A kiss? Too shallow. I wanted bite
The kind that swallows all the light.</p>

<p> Cannibal hearts know this well:
To eat is not just hunger's spell.
It’s worship, merging, holy crime
To chew you down, to steal your time.</p>

<p> For what is love but consumption slow?
A need to feel you where I go.
To tear, to taste, to make you mine,
To turn your blood into my wine.</p>

<p> If I could eat your every part,
You’d beat forever in my heart.
And in that feast, no death, no end
Just me as you, and you again.</p>

<p> So call it savage, call it sin,
But when I ate you, I let you in.
To love is loss, to love is lust
And sometimes love is to eat or rust.</p>
