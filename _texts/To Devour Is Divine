<p> They say love is tender, a rose in bloom,
<br>But I have known it as a darker tomb
<br>Where hunger lives not in the gut,
<br>But in the soul’s slow-burning rut.</p>

<p> To love you was to feel the ache
<br>Of wanting more than flesh could take
<br>Not hand in hand, but tooth to bone,
<br>To taste you wholly, not alone.</p>

<p> I craved the essence of your thought,
<br>The marrow where your secrets rot.
<br>A kiss? Too shallow. I wanted bite
<br>The kind that swallows all the light.</p>

<p> Cannibal hearts know this well:
<br>To eat is not just hunger's spell.
<br>It’s worship, merging, holy crime
<br>To chew you down, to steal your time.</p>

<p> For what is love but consumption slow?
<br>A need to feel you where I go.
<br>To tear, to taste, to make you mine,
<br>To turn your blood into my wine.</p>

<p> If I could eat your every part,
<br>You’d beat forever in my heart.
<br>And in that feast, no death, no end
<br>Just me as you, and you again.</p>

<p> So call it savage, call it sin,
<br>But when I ate you, I let you in.
<br>To love is loss, to love is lust
<br>And sometimes love is to eat or rust.</p>
