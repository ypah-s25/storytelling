<p>
She sits on the strong, steel bench.
A bench so strong that it could hold nine other people.
A bench so strong it that could hold her heavy heart.
The lights are bright,
Blinding to everyone but her.
Sounds are loud yet soft.
Chaos transpires around her,
With people running to get to catch their train.
But she stays.
Right on the strong, steel bench.
</p>
<p>
She sits on the strong, steel bench.
The one with nine other people on it.
Nine agitated, stressed, worried people.
They complain of traffic, delays and exhaustion.
She never complains.
She did once,
But emotions fluctuate,
Like sounds, colors, and people.
All at once, they get up and leave,
A step closer on their journeys to see their loved ones,
Or to be in their happy place.
But she stays.
</p>
<p>
She sits on the strong, steel bench.
The bench that once had nine other people.
Tomorrow there may be eight or ten.
They too will come and go.
But she will stay,
With her trained eyes, heavy heart, and no complaints.
</p>
