<p>ext. porch - night time</p>
<p>Dave and Tom are sitting on the porch frightened about what they just saw.</p>
<p>TOM(very quiet and out of breath)</p>
<p>I've never seen a ghost do THAT before</p>
<p>DAVE(very quiet)</p>
<p>yeah me neither, I say we head back to the van and relax. see what evidence we have gotten.</p>
<p>Tom shakes his head in agreement fast and speed walks to the van, Dave then shortly after follows. When they reach the van they both go over to their little desk setup they have and both drop their journals and look at the monitor. When they look they see something that then shakes them to their core.</p>
<p>TOM and DAVE (Really loud)</p>
<p>WE FORGET JOHAN!!</p>
<p>They both run out the van back to the house the view left on the monitor. It shows a view of a room with a person mindlessly talking through a spirit box.</p>
<p>int. house - night time</p>
<p>JOHAN</p>
<p>Anthony Gill speaks to me... Anthony says something!</p>
<p>The spirit box is just making staticky sounds with no answer. Johan pulls out his journal and crosses off spirit box in his journal. He begins to walk towards the door out of the house. When he starts to approach it he can hear banging on the front door. He begins to run to the door. As he does he can feel breath on the back of his neck. He turns his head and slows down. He sees the ghost appear right in front of his eyes. He turns back around and continues to run towards the door and doesn't make it sadly :(.</p>
<p>ext. van- NIGHT time</p>
<p>TOM</p>
<p>OHHHHH FRICK, HOW DID WE FORGET JOHAN!</p>
<p>DAVE</p>
<p>I DONT KNOW MAN I THOUGHT HE WOULD BE IN THE VAN OR SOMETHING.</p>
<p>After a few short moments they both look at each other like they are speaking telepathically.</p>
<p>TOM AND DAVE</p>
<p>we should leave.</p>
<p>They walk back to the van, slowly taking in the realization that their senior coworker is dead. Not a single tear nor peep. They enter the back of the van, turn the lights off and close the door. They walk around to the front of the van and start to drive off.</p>
