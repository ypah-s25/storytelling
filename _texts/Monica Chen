<div class="poem">
breathless<br>
a relic of light<br>
surrounded by a haze of sound<br>
your hands, alchemists<br>
bend ivory into gold<br>
each combination of touches<br>
builds a melody<br>
from nothing
</div>
<br>
<div class="poem">
rhythmic, it sounds<br>
like a heartbeat
</div>
<br>
<div class="poem">
the piano<br>
it does not sing<br>
it weeps<br>
it shouts<br>
it screams, raw and unfiltered<br>
its voice split open<br>
by your touch
</div>
<br>
<div class="poem">
from your fingertips<br>
the melody pours out<br>
like blood from a wound<br>
thick with grief<br>
sharp with longing<br>
the song chases you in a race<br>
like a wave chases a spout of wind<br>
each crescendo pulls deep into the ocean<br>
into the water<br>
drowning<br>
broken<br>
lifted<br>
gone
</div>
<br>
<div class="poem">
in that moment my breath has left me<br>
my mind and soul<br>
are no longer with me<br>
lost in a labyrinth<br>
walls of sound<br>
towering<br>
until they eclipse the light
</div>
<br>
<div class="poem">
the final note fades into dissonance<br>
my soul drifting with it<br>
slipped free from my body<br>
into the chamber
</div>
<br>
<div class="poem">
lifted away<br>
with the music<br>
drifting into the stars
</div>

<strong>About the Author:</strong><br><br>

She believes that, although humans are imperfect, art is the closest form of human expression that approaches perfection, and that is why she will continue her boundless pursuit of art. Outside of writing and art in general, Monica enjoys playing on the volleyball team, competing in piano competitions, and advocating for youth empowerment. She hopes that tomorrowâ€™s world will become shaped by art and individual expression.
