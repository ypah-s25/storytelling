<p>breathless<br>
a relic of light<br>
surrounded by a haze of sound<br>
your hands, alchemists<br>
bend ivory into gold<br>
each combination of touches<br>
builds a melody<br>
from nothing</p>

<p>rhythmic, it sounds<br>
like a heartbeat</p>

<p>the piano<br>
it does not sing<br>
it weeps<br>
it shouts<br>
it screams, raw and unfiltered<br>
its voice split open<br>
by your touch</p>

<p>from your fingertips<br>
the melody pours out<br>
like blood from a wound<br>
thick with grief<br>
sharp with longing<br>
the song chases you in a race<br>
like a wave chases a spout of wind<br>
each crescendo pulls deep into the ocean<br>
into the water<br>
drowning<br>
broken<br>
lifted<br>
gone</p>

<p>in that moment my breath has left me<br>
my mind and soul<br>
are no longer with me<br>
lost in a labyrinth<br>
walls of sound<br>
towering<br>
until they eclipse the light</p>

<p>the final note fades into dissonance<br>
my soul drifting with it<br>
slipped free from my body<br>
into the chamber</p>

<p>lifted away<br>
with the music<br>
drifting into the stars</p>
