<p>She lays in the field, the house just out of reach. She is unable to move for her legs are too weak. She crawled and crawled but her arms went numb. She tries to yell but her voice fails as her legs did. There is no clear sound from her mouth, just quiet gasps and sounds too strange to describe. In her heart all she feels in pain for the things she has lost on her way. But she keeps going, her failing body filled with hope. Despite the pain she trudges on and on. But still the house is still so far out of reach. No matter how far she crawls the house is still out of reach. Those four walls are her sanctuary and her demise. For she will crawl and crawl but fail to get closer. Every effort she takes will push her to her dying breath. Yet she can no longer feel the pain. Her mind has numbed her body of the pain. Her body burns but she is unaware. She gives everything she has, not knowing she won't last. With every inch, the distance greatens. She feels her body moving but her body goes nowhere for it is in her mind. In her mind she is moving faster than a lion but her mind tricks her. The only thing she is approaching is death. With every attempted step she only gets closer to death. Her longing and need has pushed her beyond where her body can take her. She now she will trudge for all eternity, still trying to get to the house on top of the hill. She doesnâ€™t know it but she is dead. Death has taken her faster than she knew. There was no dramatic end, no gasping until her heart gave out, no more trudging. She lays dead but her mind is still realing, longing for those four walls and ceiling.</p>
