<p>Luke was out playing soccer with his friends, “Hey! Why’d you kick so hard?!”, one of them squealed. The ball went flying over their heads and into the thicket lining the field. “Luke, it’s your turn to go get the ball.” Luke complained, "I'm not going in there!”, his friend retorted in a teasing manner, “If you don’t get it, your pokemon cards are mine!” Out of pure panic, he exclaimed, “Fine, I’ll go get it!” As he traversed through the wood, out of the corner of his eye he spotted a soft glow of shades of yellow and gold, similar to that of the sun shining through the trees on a warm spring day. As he walked towards it he came upon a clearing, and right in the middle was a golden flower. It’s six petals were an ombre of a deep royal purple in the middle blending into beautiful heaven-like golden. The moment he laid eyes on it he was almost drawn to the flower, he crept closer, and closer like it was calling to him, and he picked it. Just as he did there was almost an immediate shift in energy. His friends called out, “LUKE! Where’d you go?! WE FOUND THE BALL!!”  The yelling broke him out of the trance, and he made his way back with the flower, “Dude, you were supposed to be getting the ball not picking flowers– what type of flower even is that?”, one of his friends asked in a nitpicky way. He rolled his eyes at the remark, “It’s getting late, I’ll see you guys tomorrow.” He heard in the distance as he walked off, “So who gets the pokemon cards, y’know since he never got the ball?”</p>
