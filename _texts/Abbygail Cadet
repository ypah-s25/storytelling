<p>Once upon a time there was a little girl named Signe. Signe lived alone with her older brother Karvel. Their parents died in a drastic carriage accident a few years back and the two siblings have been sorrowfully mourning their loss ever since. Karvel struggles to make money all on his own and they aren't able to buy many things for themselves. Signe got bullied at school for how poor she is and how worn out all her clothes are which increased her sorrow tenfold. She often went out into the woods to cheer herself up.</p>
