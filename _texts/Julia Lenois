<div>They were a puppet holding their own strings</div>
<div>Worn and rough</div>
<div>Clutched so tightly in wooden fingers they had begun to gone numb</div>
<div>Limbs clunking together as they tried to pirouette</div>
<div>Like the other girls had done in ballet</div>
<div>Apart of the audience once they’d watch</div>
<div>How easily they glided, with their spooling shades of white</div>
<div>their pointed feet kissed the floors</div>
<div>arms in arcs that painted the stage in heavenly shades</div>
<div>With their own ethereal language that exceeded tongue</div>
<div>Perfect control of their porcelain bodies</div>
<div>They needed no strings</div>
<div>They burned with talent, a beautiful blaze</div>
<div>The kind that leaves stars in your eyes long after it decays</div>
<div>The stage had gone dim when the young puppet wished</div>
<div>‘How I wish I had their grace’</div>
<div>But their scarred oak joints creaked with each twist</div>
<div>Tangling and splintering</div>
<div>Their flat wooden feet scrapped across the floor, bruised from misuse for a dance they were not made for</div>
<div>From the strain of holding themself up they forgot to look back</div>
<div>To see how despite the others grace they too had been cracked</div>
<div>Surrounded by their own brilliance, they could not see how they were now what other girls wished to become</div>
<div>But perhaps one more routine</div>
<div>Would finally settle their need></div>
<div>To be a star, more than just a puppet on strings</div>
