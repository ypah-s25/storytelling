<p>The rose petals wilt and fall as time goes on.
All the love and care that was once poured into them,no longer a factor in the state that they are in.
We end up looking to the sky and cursing time for stealing the light away, stealing the beauty and wonder life once had.</p>
<p>But oh, how time is the most elegant of thieves.
Choosing to bargain like a merchant instead of swiping from our grasp.</p>
<p>Instead of ripping the beauty off the flower's delegate surface, it trades it for the gift of kindness and nurtures it from within.</p>
