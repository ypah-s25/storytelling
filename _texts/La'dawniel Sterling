<p>Hi my name is Juniper & I'm low need autistic. I often Stim by jumping up and down while flailing my hands, and chewing on my hoodie string. I love reading. I even have my own book shelf that is organised by color & size. my current favorite is Ever After High I LOVE Raven she is so cool ahhh! My mommy said I'm too much because of my autism. I don't know what she meant although during Christmas I went downstairs in my favorite PJs that have cute cows on them. I went to the Christmas tree to check out how many presents Santa left me. I noticed that while I have 12 my brother has 10, my mother has 11, but my father has 3. I went up to my mommy and asked why did sana give daddy ony 3 presents even though hes verry good mommy got mad at me and she yielded to me to stop being weird and that counting presents is rude. I guess I was being too much. I should learn to behave better.</p>
