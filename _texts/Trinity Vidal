<p>The light bulb is broken
<br>I can't remember how long it's been that way
<br>The windows are boarded up
<br>No light comes in from there
<br>The only thing I can see is my paint and brush
<br>Oh, and white writing on the walls
<br>I dip my brush in paint and decorate my wall with the words that haunt me day and night
<br>My Dear, why don't you put down the brush
<br>Why don't you stop painting the words that torment you so much
<br>Don't you know the brush is in your hands
<br>Don't you know that it will do whatever you command
</p>
