<p>The light bulb is broken</p>
<p>I can't remember how long it's been that way</p>
<p>The windows are boarded up</p>
<p>No light comes in from there</p>
<p>The only thing I can see is my paint and brush</p>
<p>Oh, and white writing on the walls</p>
<p>All day I dip my brush in paint and decorate my wall with the words that haunt me day and night</p>
<p>My Dear, why don't you put down the brush</p>
<p>Why don't you stop painting the words that torment you so much</p>
<p>Don't you know the brush is in your hands</p>
<p>Don't you know that it will do whatever you command</p>
