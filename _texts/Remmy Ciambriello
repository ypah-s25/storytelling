<p>Isn’t it a funny little thing?<br>
Or maybe not so little at all<br>
Intangible yet it feels almost<br>
as if I could touch it, like I could<br>
take it into my hands and try and<br> 
try to crush it into nothingness<br>
But I fail.</p>

<p>There are raw screaming throats and soft sobs<br>
There is a din and a quiet both<br>
A silent demon, bringing out the<br>
primal, an animal rising to<br> 
the surface.</p>

<p>It’s the feeling of being eaten<br>
Slowly gnawed until I am nothing<br>
but an empty shell<br>
It is also a feeling of exploding<br>
So filled up by these strange emotions that<br> 
all I can do is shatter.</p>

<p>Yes, there are ebbs and flows, in this clumsy, silken river<br>
Eventually, there is healing, pain subsiding<br>
And there is building,<br>
bridges and skyscrapers form over this void<br>
The forest regrows after the fire<br>
As will I<br>
As will you</p>
